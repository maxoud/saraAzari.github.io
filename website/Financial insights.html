			Financial insights brings real time visibility into how a SNF is performing in terms of PDPM revenue. Performance information is available at mutiple levels, including organizational, facility, and resident level.

 		<h2>Why</h2>
 		<h3>Problem definition and use case</h3>
 		<p>
			CMS (centers for medicare and medicaid services) introduced PDPM (patient driven payment model) and SNFs (Senior nursing facilities) needed to make changes and adapt.
			PDPM revolutionized how SNFs operate by changing the way SNFs get paid and ensuring coordinated, quality care becomes a reality. <br>
			Upcoming changes in the processes concerned Pointclickcare customers, and product managers spotted the need to provide the customers with a real-time, dashboard-like solution that could give SNF administrators quick and ready to consume insights on how their facilities are doing.
		</p>
 		<h2>Who</h2>
 		<p>
 			Target persona for Financial Insights is Adam, the administrator.

 		<br>
 		<h2>The process</h2>
 		<h3>User research</h3>
 		<p>
 			PDPM was a new concept to everyone, and users naturally did not use this product before. This means all the user research prior to release had to be done with users that had no idea what they were expecting from this product. This made user testing to be a little challenging. Customers were still excited that an analytics product was on its way to help them make decisions fast and easy, and without having to look at multiple excel pages and studying numbers.<br>
			During bi-weekly remote feedback sessions with 4 customers prior to the first release, decisions about the direction the product was going were made. Some of the most helpful pieces of feedback include
			<li>Learning based on which KPIs administrators make decisions. This is important because we wanted cater the information presented to users without taking away any value</li> 
			<li>Dashboard content: Users helped us narrow down and prioritize the number of KPIs that we included on the “overview page” of the application. This is important because we wanted this page to give users the most valuable insight, as fast as possible</li>
		</p>
		<h2>Wireframes and prototypes</h2>
		Starting with pen/paper and whiteboard, we needed to figure out two major challenges for this project: the information architecture, and the information density.

 		<h4>Challenges</h4>
 		<ul>
 			<li><p>Navigation
Thank god for all the whiteboard walls around the office! Defining the scope of concepts, and how they make sense together was not easy in the beginning. We were considering coming up with a formula that can be applied to other analytics products that were coming our way in the future, while wanting to make this experience as smooth and intuitive as it can get. Users were helpful with this of course! We learned it worked best with users mental model if they started looking at the bigger picture, and drill-through to get more detailed info about what looked interesting.


Target or budget?
Similar to every other business, SNF administrators along with their financial officers set targets for each facility, but they call them budgets, sometimes, and instead of defining it for a fiscal year, they define them daily. Learning about this misconception came with a price of us designing target setting pages a few times, each time with different requirements.

Information overload (Design system problems)  > tables having too many columns
Pointclickcare design system, Evergreen, does not allow for more than 7 columns, and we all know tables in analytics products can be pretty messy. We were able to solve this problem by introducing expandable rows to tables with more than 7 columns. You can see more information about that row by expanding the row. 
Industry knowledge
We needed to learn about PDPM in order to provide this solution.

 		<p>In general, MEMOME can be used by people with dementia and their caregivers.</p>

 		<h3>The Solution</h3> 	

 			
 		<h4>Collaboration</h4>
 		<p>
 			I worked on the UX aspect of this project with Bruce Ashtiani, Sr. UX desinger at PointClickCare.
 		<p>
 			, not only from a technology perspective but also from a process standpoint. PDPM means value based, person driven care.
 			SNFs have to keep up to be able to compete
 			From clinical KPIs to readmission rates, No longer will they have to wait for logging CMS ratings, or spend hours compiling metrics to see how they’re doing. Performance information is at their fingertips and available at mutiple levels, including organizational, facility, and resident level.
